DESCRIPTION:

An audio unit (often abbreviated as AU in header files and elsewhere) is a Mac OS X plug-in that enhances digital audio applications such as Logic Pro and GarageBand. You can also use audio units to build audio features into your own application. Programmatically, an audio unit is packaged as a bundle and configured as a component.

This sample is a "Hello World" starter project demonstrating how to build a Core Audio Audio Unit Effect with a custom Cocoa View. 

The project builds a final AU component called MyGreatAUEffectWithCocoaUI.component with the following Type, SubType and Manufacturer.
